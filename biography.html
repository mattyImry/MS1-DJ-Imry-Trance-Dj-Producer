          resident in the UK. His musical journey started at early age hitting
          the dance floors across Europe in the early 90 when trance, hardcore
          and techno were changing the way music was listened and followed. After
          going behind the desks around the year 2000 playing Hardcore for
          parties in and around Italy the game change came around 2004 when he
          started going to psytrance parties in Europe.

          The debute as a producer came in 2014 with the release of his first
          remix of Omsphere track “A World Without End” following a VA “
          Reawakening vol 4”, which were both released on Free-Spirit Records
          and both releases entered the charts. Imry made his name on the
          progressive scene due to his music selection and the sequence the
          tracks are played. You can understand his concept listening to his
          production where the grooves and melodies melt to create a deep
          sentimental progression. <br />
          “Progression is a fundamental element in nature which cannot be missed
          while producing music.” Imry
